We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 

Operations Business Assistant

Task 1
Rohlik plans to introduce reusable bags. The supplier is able to provide us with a bag that can be used up to 16 times. Cost of the bag is EUR 0,5, the cost of washing is EUR 0,10. Paper bag cost is EUR 0,07. We use approximately 1m bags/month, in 300 000 orders, done by 100 000 customers, we expect that every customer will keep one bag per month. 

	- What does the business case look like? 
	- How to make the case work for Rohlik’s P&L and Rohlik customers? 
- Have an excel or google sheet model ready with you.

Task 2
Your friends ask you for help as a business consultant. They are thinking about opening a hot dog stand in Prague and want your business advice and evaluation before they proceed. 

	- Should they do it?

	- Is it a good idea? What would be your advice?

Task 3
One of the key differentiators of Rohlik’s customer proposition is a great Customer Care department (call centre responding to emails, calls and chats). We can see that lately customer experience with our customer care dept. is deteriorating, i.e. customer satisfaction is dropping down (CSAT has dropped by 6 pp in the past month). You are tasked to figure out what is going on, reverse the trend and improve the customer experience.

How would you solve this?

Adjust the code from step a) to contain the number of delivered orders per cohort per month.
Payment methods summary 
Write pseudo-SQL code which you would use to prepare a table which would contain the frequency of occurrence of a product category in all orders grouped by customers’ state.
Adjust the code from the previous step by adding the payment type to it, however, only list the 3 most common payment types, and group the rest under other. Pivot the table to contain the payment type categories in columns.
Process structuring 
Imagine you have a table that contains transactional data in rows. The table has the following structure: 
Month
Provider
Code 1
Code 2
Numeric value
The company would like to map the code values to specific aggregate measures (let’s assign them values A, B, C, D, E), however, this mapping can change over time. The past versions of the mapping, though, need to stay in place. How would you set up the mapping process in order to allow business users to make changes to the mapping if necessary in a way that would not require your help whenever the mapping changes?
Bonus Task
Pull the full list of Rick and Morty characters and episodes using a custom built extractor (built in Python or R) from the API endpoints available on https://rickandmortyapi.com/.
Transform the JSON responses into separate flat tables.
Prepare a table that will contain the following columns: 
episode
episode_name
character_name

Prepare a summary table in which you sort the trios that appear together most often based on their frequency in all episodes in a descending order, however, the trios must not contain Rick and Morty together. Specify the number of occurrences per trio per season in columns.

=== Case study - Database Expert (1).docx ===
Case study

We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 

Database Expert

What would you recommend to do and we could discuss it with a broader audience next time ?

Consider following scenario 
MySQL Server 8 (InnoDB) with principal, basically “monolithic” schema (cca 1000 tables)
15 other system schemas / databases (per microservice)
60 applications using MySQL DB, most of them principal schema (1).
applications itself are (with exception of database) designed as micro services
one main schema “rohlik” occupying 85% of disk size
Disc space occupied 1,5 TB (+ cca 100 G for logistic DB which is running on another server)
We have separated databases per each country where rohlik operates
Country databases are the same structure (holding country specific data)
In Czech rep. we distribute approx 25 000 orders every day, provided metrics are for CZ databases - just to have some raw idea about the performance.
Our plan is to be able to delivery 1M order across all countries, we can expect in biggest countries around 200 000 orders daily (that is estimated load to one country DB)
Main schema rohlik contains around 1000 tables – the biggest tables (by size) are as follows (just to give you some overview how its unbalanced):





Current "architecture" of the main CZ rohlik DB is:



Consider workload of database illustrated by few following metrics for last 24 hours as sample (left is master, right is app replica):
 






Topics we'd like to discuss:
Do you need more input ? What ?
How to improve overall availability of DB
its required to be able to run 24/7. Therefore if possible, its required to operate with DB even during maintenance / upgrades etc
 In case of DB failure, we need as fast failover as possible. What would be your design ?
just a note: we don't have good experiences with Galera cluster.
Consider:
we use ProxySQL but everything is allowed, e.g. keepalived, HAProxy, MySQLRouter, etc … Easier to stay with Percona MySQL but not mandatory.
Performance improvements
all necessary information are available (slow log, pmm / query analytics, …).
How would you proceed with improving DB's performance. 
except application changes / query tunning (which might be time demanding  process), what would be your steps on DB side with proposed architecture 
basically what would you do as "quick wins"
 HA
As rohlik grows, every minute of outage becomes more and more expensive for us (not just the website but warehouses. logistic are now affected by db outages)
We plan to:
- unify our applications to serve requests from countries (now its separated openshift deployment per each country).
- have production infrastructure ready in another independent data center (or cloud ?) for immediate failover (or perhaps maybe even for load balancing)

What would be your design here (DB related) ?



=== Case Study - Head of Construction & Facility.docx ===




We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 


Head of Construction & Facility 

Situation 1
We are opening many Fulfilment Centers (FC) in different countries for the next 18 months. All designs are outsourced, and we are leasing our FCs. The current expansion team, which does not have the full expertise in that area, is leading those projects by ensuring the construction is done on time with our current developers and relying on external consultants 

You have been assigned to build a team and define the optimum way to both reach the deadlines of construction according to local regulations as well as optimizing our costs. We noticed in one of our countries that the overall rents have increased by 300% September ytd. Racks and conveyors are ordered by the countries and our costs have increased by 40%.

Task 1
Can you share with us your short term plan to reduce our costs of racks and conveyors by 20% by the end of December and your strategic views for the next 18 months in terms of negotiation of our FC rental to reduce them by at least 15%?

Situation 2
Your role is also to manage all facilities of our Company. Our facility managers in our countries don’t have a clear view on their duties and responsibilities. Furthermore, they don’t have any budget to follow and don’t understand their duties. In one of our countries, energy costs have increased YTD over 60%, cleaning by 500%, security by 400% and our forklift rental by 500%

Task 2
What is your immediate action plan to reduce our overall costs by 20% in a sustainable way for the next financial year which begins in May 2022?
Can you also share with us how you will drastically change this way of working for your team? What will be the top 3 points you will focus on in the next 2 months to make them accountable, entrepreneurs and proactive?
What will be your future views on the structure in the countries as well as at Group level?

Format
Result of the case study should be captured in a format of your choice that is easily shareable with us during the next meeting. We don’t need you to write essays, clear and consistent content is much more important to us. Please send us the presentation materials of your Case study 1 day prior to the meeting so we can review and get ready for the talk.

=== Case Study - Process Manager (2).docx ===
Case Study: Process Manager
Optimizing Fulfillment Center Operations
Background
You are a Process Manager at a rapidly expanding e-commerce grocery company. The company has several fulfillment centers across different countries, each with its own set of operational challenges. Your task is to optimize the operations of these fulfillment centers to enhance efficiency and reduce the costs.
Scenario 1
Outbound performance of our fulfillment center in Munich (MUC) is not reaching expected productivity in recent weeks. As the site possesses equipment for automated picking and expedition we should be able to reach 110 SKU / man-hour weekly average outbound performance. 
We need to assist the local team in finding root causes and help them draft corrective actions. 
 
Context
Outbound consist of 3 main processes:
Picking: picking of products to the bags which are placed to the totes for transport via conveyors 
Part of SKUs is picked in Autostore 
Rest in sectors with standard manual picking 
Expedition buffer: manipulation of bags from totes arriving on conveyor to buffer shelves in expedition
This process happens only for part of volume which does not go to automated expedition (in automated expedition totes with bags are placed to buffer shelves without consumption of labor)  
Courier buffer: loading of bags from expedition buffer to trolleys which are later picked up by couriers for loading to cars 
In case of automated expedition worker picks bags from flow racks to which bags in totes are prepared by automated solution 
In case of manual expedition 
MUC is the only site which have already installed automated expedition, other sites included in case study have automated picking 
We distinguish activities into two types:
Measured: activity in which we can measure performance (worker is using PDA and we track his actions)
Unmeasured: activity for which we measure only spend time (for example “cleaning” or management activities)
Outbound performance is calculated as amount of picked SKU (order lines) divided by all hours spend in outbound activities

Task
Identify patterns in the attached data and state hypotheses on root causes for performance variations and/or lower performance
Propose how to test the hypothesis 
Define the corrective actions: both short term fixes and long term solutions - how to reach higher productivity
In case you miss some data state what would help you to go deeper
List key points which needs to be considered for implementation of your proposed solutions (what can be the blockers, risks, assumptions, what resources are needed)
Data
Performance statistics: MUC core processes performance in time - file
Daily volume, productivity & quality metrics of selected sites in the group - file
Daily statistics for all processes / activities in Outbound MUC - file

Deliverable:
The form of presentation of the case study is open: it can be powerpoint, word document, sheet or any other form.
You will present it with your voiceover.  Presentation should not be longer than 15 minutes.

=== Case Study - Product Owner Pricing, Assortment & Commercial Processes.docx ===




We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 

Product Owner Pricing, Assortment & Commercial Processes

Part A: Pricing & Promotions
Situation
As Product Owner, you are responsible for setting the Pricing strategy of our Group and for delivering the pricing engine that operationalizes the strategy and calculates prices for the different countries, ideally in full automation. You also define and manage our price markdowns strategy and optimize our promotion program. Imagine that our pricing strategy were just at the beginning, processes are mostly manual with limited governance, and we don’t know exactly our price positioning and price image on the market.

Task
Propose 3 basic use cases, which the pricing engine should support. Estimate the business impact of 1-2 of these use cases, and any expected impact on customers
How would you approach the cooperation with local commercial teams in our countries?
Which requests would you have to BI and Machine Learning teams?
What is your long-term vision for a world-class pricing policy and engine? What are key milestones?

Part B: Category Review Process
Situation (in addition, you should have received a presentation and a sheet with data)
The pricing & assortment squad has created a framework for the systematic development assortments through internal and competitive benchmarks called category reviews. In this process you conduct a series of exercises to (a) identify and close assortment gaps, (b) identify and de-list assortment duplicates and (c) identify and stop margin leakage through low-profitability items. The framework comes with various tools for easy setup. You are now charged with the roll-out/ value creation for category reviews.

Task
Looking at the high-level data provided in the presentation, which sub-category(ies) would you prioritize for an in-depth category review and why?
Looking at the lower level data provided in Excel/ google sheets, which opportunities do you see in the prioritized sub-category(ies) from 1 (name at least 3)?
For the summer, we want to significantly reduce the number of chocolate SKUs. Ideally, we start by removing duplicates in the assortment. How would you systematically identify such assortment duplicates? You are not limited to the provided data, please describe your approach in detail.

Additional Information: The exercise should not take you more than a few hours to prepare. If you need additional data - ask for it.

Format
Please prepare a structured presentation (text or slides, up to you) for each of the points and assume key Q&A already in your preparation. The presentation will be pre-read by the interviewers so you may or may not need to present it but there will surely be a lot of probing questions.

=== Case Study - Product Owner Supply Chain.docx ===




We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 

Product Owner Supply Chain

Part A: Autonomous Ordering for Fruit & Vegetables
Situation (in addition, you should have received a presentation and a sheet with data)
Developing an autonomous ordering system for fresh produce, such as fruits and vegetables, presents unique challenges due to the perishable nature of these items, and a lack of product standardization. The goal is to leverage AI to create a system that optimizes order quantities, minimizes waste, and ensures product freshness.

Task
What features must be developed to pull off autonomous ordering for fruits and vegetables?
How would you measure the success of the initiative to introduce an autonomous ordering system for fruits and vegetables? Please distinguish between input (anything you can change directly like forecasting accuracy) and output (anything that confirms the success of your initiative like item availability) metrics.

Part B: Supplier Management
Situation
As Product Owner, you are responsible for creating a fully autonomous supply chain solution. Besides autonomous ordering (which we discussed above), we also want to automate supply chain related interaction with our suppliers. Currently, our supplier interaction is highly manual, lacking any automation, and does not leverage the full potential of today’s AI possibilities. We aim to establish a robust supplier management system that not only streamlines interactions but also enhances supplier performance, reduces risks, and ensures supply chain resilience.

Task
Propose 3 basic use cases for the supplier management system (anything that is related to generating and sending out orders). Estimate the business impact of 1-2 of these use cases, and any expected impact on our suppliers
How would you approach the cooperation with local supply chain teams in our countries to make your developments a success?
Which requests would you have to BI and Machine Learning teams?
What is your long-term vision for a world-class supplier management system? What are key milestones?

Additional Information: The exercise should not take you more than a few hours to prepare. If you need additional data - ask for it.

Format
Please prepare a structured presentation (text or slides, up to you) for each of the points and assume key Q&A already in your preparation. The presentation will be pre-read by the interviewers so you may or may not need to present it but there will surely be a lot of probing questions.

=== Case Study - UX Designer_ Operations Systems.docx ===
Case Study: UX Designer - Operations Systems  
Background
You are an UX Designer working in a rapidly growing e-grocery company. You are an owner of design concepts in all the operations areas: starting from receipt of the products from our suppliers up to the handover of shopping by our courier to the customer.
The challenge is to  
Scenario 1 - Last Minute Application Rework 
Last Minute application is an application handling movement of products from standard stock to “Last Minute” stock, including physical movement of product to a new position. Last Minute stock contains products which are close to expiration or with any other flaw (e.g. damaged package) and we sell them with a significant discount. The purpose of this move and discount is to make sure we limit the value of goods which are fully lost and therefore decrease shrink (value of goods which are written off)  

Visual Materials: here
Screenshots of current APP
Video with application flow 
Context
The application is installed on Zebra devices (Android) and is used by regular warehouse workers (blue collars). There has to be several workers trained with it per site which also have multiple other tasks.
There is a report of items to be expiring which is used 
Your Task 
Current version of Last minute application is outdated: 
It's not navigating user through standard flow
There are too many decision points 
It requires extensive training
The design is not up to latest best practices 
Please propose improved process flow and setup of screens, steps 
Analysis of current state / UX check
Answer questions: 
How would you trigger a request for a Last Minute move?
How would you effectively allocate workers for execution? 
What are the biggest gaps of current solution? 
Any general ideas for process improvement? (you can propose full scale alternative)
Format
The form of presentation of the case study is open: it can be powerpoint, chart, word document, sheet or any other form.
You will present it with your voiceover. Presentation should not be longer than 20 minutes.

Business Optimization Lead CZ

Situation
One of the key differentiators of Rohlik’s customer proposition is a great Customer Care
department (call centre responding to emails, calls and chats). We can see that lately
customer experience with our customer care dept. is deteriorating, i.e. customer satisfaction
is dropping down (CSAT has dropped by 6 pp in the past month). 


Task 1:
You are tasked to figure out what is going on, reverse the trend and improve the customer experience. How would you solve this problem? Please, describe steps, stakeholders and a very
thorough timeline.

Please, invest maximum 1 hour effort into preparation of the output.

Task 2
Describe one of the bad customer experiences you have encountered lately and put together
a plan of how you would improve the experience if you were asked to do so as a responsible
interim member of the management team of that company.
Put together a brief description of what was the situation and an improvement plan in the
form of slides or a structured text document.

Please, invest maximum 1 hour effort into preparation of the output.

Format
We are not strictly set on the form of the presentation. Whatever works for you and you are comfortable with, works for us.

=== Case Study Category Manager (Private Label) .docx ===




We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 


Category Manager (Private Label) 

Situation
At Rohlik we have two kinds of private labels. The first one is the premium brand “Bez kompromisu” (in EN "No Compromise"), which is focusing on non-price-sensitive customers. Under this brand we would like to offer only excellent products that are highest quality and are from small & authentic local producers and farmers, i.e. they are not industrial produced. This brand is part of what Rohlik Group stands for and expresses Rohlik DNA: “eat well and live well”. We intend to have only one premium brand for all our product categories, i.e. no different premium brands for different product categories. We are still working on this concept and for a better insight, you can take a look at our existing premium private label “Bez kompromisu” (in EN "No Compromise"), which is currently available only at Rohlik.cz.

The second family of private labels are “Tertiary brands”. These products have very good quality with very competitive selling prices. With these SKUs we want to attract especially more price-sensitive customers who now buy traditional private labels in brick & mortar retailers. Mostly these are products with A-brand quality but at a significantly cheaper price. Currently we are selling these products under the brands “Miil” (dairy category), “Dacello” (processed meat category) and “Moddia” (paper hygiene category).

You as a category manager/Buyer in a private label squad were asked by the Group Head of Private Label to review the “Frozen vegetables” category and make suggestions how to grow this category faster via category management and  private label launch and how to ensure higher customer and basket penetration. In supporting excel sheet you will find virtual data pack with fictive numbers (NR -  Net revenue, Packages -  sold packages, Margin).

Task
Make in-depth analysis of existing assortment in Frozen vegetables category based on the shared data pack, Rohlik.cz homepage and store check by competitors
Bring a clear plan how to drive sales numbers of this category through listing of new products under private label, try to identify top sellers suitable for private label (incl. target selling price and margin) and try to find new trends in this category. Of course you can bring improvement ideas for brand assortment as well :).
Think about how the listing of private label affect behaviour of existing customers and FTUs
Focus on price perception and price policy
Work with different price sensitivity of our customers



Check if your results are working across the group, because you are not responsible for only one market

Additional  Information
The exercise should not take you more than a few hours to prepare.
We will then go through the case study together during an interview/video call, the case study presentation should not take more than 20 minutes.

Head of IT operations 
Situation 
Rohlik has its own internal Tech department and runs on “in-house” applications. All core systems/components are built internally so also we have to support them. Sometimes a customer has an issue with the website so he contacts Customer support. Sometimes someone from our colleagues has an issue with the internal system. We have to be able to react to these situations.

Only back-end developers do 3rd level support. We have 25 of them.

We have 3 main technology streams with:
e-shop development - 10 devs
warehouse system development - 12 devs
logistic system development - 3 devs

BE devs are not able to cover another stream (e.g. web developers can’t support warehouse system).

Rohlik operates in 5 countries (CZ, HU, DE, AT, RO). We have 1800+ people (employees) in the Rohlik Group who potentially can contact IT for support.
Task  
Define/design the whole IT support process.
Design the process and organizational structure
Describe dotted processes, activities, steps, parties/departments, people etc. Think about the future stages (Rohlik now operates in 5 countries, 10 fulfillment centers, what if it’s much more...)
Define KPIs for “IT support process” to measure its performance
Format 
We are not strictly set on the form of the presentation. Whatever works for you and you are  comfortable with, works for us.

We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 


Learning & Development Specialist

Situation 1
Our company has encountered a challenge in enhancing the perception and understanding of Rohlik’s key ingredients among employees. These ingredients are foundational to Rohlik’s mission and values, yet recent surveys indicate that employees across several departments have a superficial understanding of these elements, affecting their ability to fully integrate these concepts into their roles and customer interactions. This gap in understanding is especially pronounced among new hires, who are critical to the company’s ongoing growth and success.

Task
As a Learning & Development Specialist, you are tasked with creating a learning program aimed at deepening employees' comprehension and appreciation of Rohlik’s key ingredients. The objective is to ensure that all team members can articulate and leverage these ingredients in their daily work and external communications, thereby enhancing the overall brand consistency and customer experience.


Situation 2
During the recent Talent & Performance Review process at Rohlik, two distinct groups of employees were identified: one consisting of high performers and high potentials, and another needing targeted improvement plans. The high performers group is recognized for their exceptional contributions and potential for leadership, while the latter group has shown areas requiring development to meet Rohlik’s performance standards. Both groups require specific developmental attention to ensure their growth aligns with organizational goals.

Task 2
As the Learning & Development Specialist, your objective is to devise and execute distinct, tailored programs for both groups. Your plan should detail the actions needed, investment requirements, and key stakeholders involved, aiming to enhance the skill set of the improvement-required group and to prepare high performers for future leadership roles.








Situation 3
Rohlik has recently expanded its Learning Management System (LMS) offerings to include a wider range of courses aimed at enhancing employee skills across all levels. However, engagement metrics and course completion rates are lower than expected, suggesting that employees are not fully utilizing the system as intended.

Task 3
As the Learning & Development Specialist, you are tasked with optimizing the LMS to improve user engagement and course completion rates. Your plan should focus on making the LMS more user-friendly, relevant, and accessible to all employees, ensuring that they can benefit from the learning opportunities available.

We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group as

IT L2 Support Specialist

L2 Support Candidate Case Study Exercise:
Objective
This case study aims to assess your ability to prioritize support issues effectively based on urgency, impact on business operations, and potential disruptions to customer service. In Scenario 1 you will be provided with 1 issue to solve in detail. In Scenario 2 you will be provided with 5 issues and your task is to order the issues from the most pressing to the least pressing while justifying your reasoning for the prioritization.
This is not simply a technical exercise, but an opportunity for you to demonstrate your thought process in handling a variety of tickets that could impact different areas of an e-commerce business. You will present your analysis in the next round of the interview. The format of your presentation is flexible and can be tailored to your strengths.
Company Background
Rohlik Group, founded in 2014 in the Czech Republic, is a leading European online grocery delivery service. We operate in multiple countries, including the Czech Republic (Rohlik.cz), Hungary (Kifli.hu), Austria (Gurkerl.at), Germany (Knuspr.de), and Romania (Sezamo.ro). We pride ourselves on deploying world-leading technology and logistics to deliver over 17,000 SKUs within 60 minutes, and over 50,000 orders daily, using our own fleet of couriers. With end-to-end control of our operations and technology, our customers expect a high-quality, seamless shopping experience.
The Scenarios
Note: You have time to prepare the answers at home and present your solution during the next interview round.
Scenario 1
Issue: Inaccurate Order Confirmations (JIRA Ticket)
Customers are receiving incorrect order confirmation emails and SMS. Some customers are receiving confirmations for orders they didn’t place, while others aren’t receiving any confirmation at all. The Customer Support team raised this issue in JIRA after multiple complaints.
Your Task:
Describe in detail how you would approach resolving this issue.
What steps would you take to troubleshoot this issue?
Which tools would you use when searching for solution?

Scenario 2
Below are five issues that have entered the ticket pipeline via different channels (JIRA, Slack, and phone) approximately at the same time. Your task is to take care of these issues and provide a rationale for your decisions.
Issue 1: Warehouse Management System (WMS) Downtime (JIRA Ticket)
A critical bug in the Warehouse Management System is preventing couriers from being able to check out orders on the warehouse that are ready for delivery. The entire delivery system is halted as a result. The issue was reported via JIRA by a warehouse supervisor.
Issue 2: Payment Gateway Failure (Phone Call)
Multiple customers are unable to complete their transactions at checkout due to a payment gateway failure. This issue was reported via a phone call from the Customer Support team. They have received numerous complaints in the last 30 minutes.
Issue 3: CEO Unable to Access Email (Slack Post)
The CEO has posted in the IT support Slack channel, reporting that they are unable to access their email account. They have a series of important meetings later in the day and need urgent access.
Issue 4: Stock Management System Sync Delay (JIRA Ticket)
There is a delay in syncing stock data between the online store and the central stock management system. This is causing discrepancies between available stock displayed on the webshop and actual stock in the warehouses. The issue was raised in JIRA by the Operations team.
Issue 5: Website Search Functionality not working (JIRA Ticket)
A glitch in the website’s search functionality is causing certain product categories (e.g., fresh produce) to not appear in search results. This was reported in JIRA by the Marketing/Listing team after adding items to those categories.
Your Task:
In what order would you resolve these issues and why?
Your responses will be evaluated based on clarity, logical reasoning, use of technical knowledge, and communication skills in English. 
Be prepared to present your solution in any format you prefer (e.g. Chart, PowerPoint, written memo, verbal explanation, etc.).



For Evaluators
Solution evaluation and criteria:
Task: Are the issues prioritized accordingly? Consider the explanation provided and users limited knowledge of rohlik systems.
Focus: Are factors like business disruption, customer impact, and overall urgency considered?

Questions or prompts:
What might be causing the issue (on the customer's side and on the company's side, 3rd party side)?
How would you collaborate with other teams if needed?

Areas to evaluate:
Problem-Solving Approach:
Logical breakdown of the problem.
Correct identification of potential root causes.

DevOps engineer

Imagine a situation where you have an in-house programmed e-shop, but your business has taken off so that there is potential for expansion to other countries.

How would you choose the hardware and infrastructure to handle the required user traffic?
How would you support rapid application development?

No need to write a novel. It's all about seeing the direction of thinking. The task specification is deliberately quite vague.

Just let us know. 








Rohlik Culture Code

Our mission
Our goal in life is to make other peoples’ lives better. We do it by delivering quality groceries in a
fast and convenient manner. We want to gradually change the way people buy groceries, so
that they enjoy healthier and happier lives, spending more time doing what they love rather than
waiting in traffic and supermarket queues.
We fully realize that changing the old habit of going to a grocery store is not an easy feat. That’s
why we believe that what we build at Rohlik must not just be better than the traditional way of
shopping, but ten times better…

Life at Rohlik
Building such a life-changing business is not for everyone. Such a mission is difficult. Life at
Rohlik is difficult.
We find our entrepreneurial culture to be both exciting and challenging, because we are never
stuck maintaining an existing product, but are instead focused on developing new product ideas
and strategies.
Rather than agreeing with each other to make our lives easier, we often disagree to be better
and make our customers’ lives easier.
We like to be quick. We have a big mission ahead of us and we need to move fast to succeed.
There is no time for long e-mails, long presentations, long monologues. Sometimes there is no
time for pleasantries. Get. To. The. Point. And get stuff done.
We are doing something that has never been done before in the grocery business. Clearly we
rarely succeed at the first shot. We fail more often creating new things that we were used to in
our previous lives, but that’s ok.

Continuous Improvement
We didn’t join Rohlik to make our lives more comfortable. Changing what people think and how
they shop is difficult. It’s a somewhat painful process for our customers and it’s also painful for
us. Sometimes it hurts to step out of the comfort zone. We do it anyway, because we know it
helps us have stronger ideas and move forward faster.

We like to weigh different ideas: sometimes we go ahead and try, sometimes we adjust and
make it better, sometimes we park it for later, sometimes we kill it completely. The intention is
always to make Rohlik better. Having your idea or your area challenged often feels personal.
But remember, this is not about our ego, this is about making our customers’ lives better.
Best way to get better is to admit our mistakes, provide and accept feedback and adjust
accordingly. To err is human. We need people who are not afraid of making mistakes, but then
also don’t shy away from facing the truth.

Who we hire
People who work at Rohlik are independent thinkers with an opinion. We are not afraid of saying
what we think is right for our customers or for the business.


Rohlik people are passionate about helping our customers live healthier and happier lives. We
want this to happen and we want it quickly.We hire people who want to change the world and are ready to take up difficult tasks with some tripping over.
Rohlik people don’t wait to be told what to do but themselves propose new ways to get better.
We hire people who want to spend their lives at work this way. We have a versatile mix. Both
young and older, both junior and senior experienced colleagues.

Your Personal Rohlikness Check
This little checklist is made for you. It may be hard to imagine what life with Rohlik will be like.
These eight questions help you see for yourself if you would like it or not. Please, answer the
questions truthfully. If you don’t, it will only make your life miserable in the future. We don’t want
that.

❏ I like to learn new things
❏ I try out new tools and techniques to improve what I do
❏ I easily adjust to changing circumstances
❏ I stay calm under pressure
❏ I work with data efficiently



Winning
Market standard is not good enough. We aim to win, be the best and ahead of the market. We
keep innovating.
❏ I keep coming up with new ideas
❏ I have a vision/goal/dream and I pursue it.
❏ I have a passion and I’m able to sacrifice something to achieve it
❏ I push through despite some setbacks along the road

We are open and honest to ourselves, to our team mates and to our customers. We are able to
accept feedback.
❏ I make mistakes and I admit them
❏ I stick my neck out for people and things that matter
❏ I’ll keep challenging other people’s opinion until an optimal solution is found
❏ When I am convinced something is not right, I say it openly

I believe in success, I want to win and I know I can, I see the big picture
Everything I do, I do for the customer
I have ownership, I keep things moving/improving/upgrading. I don’t leave things
unfinished.
I have courage to do things differently, I explore new ways, there is no “normal” for me, I see and go beyond market standards. I am curious, I learn
A solution is better than no solution. Solutions require decision making. I make
decisions, I accept responsibility for outcome. I ask for help to get things done.
AND THE SPEED WILL ALWAYS BE THERE…. AMEN

Task 1 
Define how you would introduce an agile way of working at Rohlik. Describe activities, steps, parties/departments, people etc. etc. What approach and roadmap would you recommend? What are the next evolutionary steps in agility after we have squads successfully running for more than a year?

OKRs that are not well defined (e.g. objective is not significant enough, KRs do not prove fulfilment of objectives, we missing measurement)
As an owner of the OKR framework, how would you improve this situation? If you miss information, make assumptions.


Format
Result of the case study should be captured in a format of your choice that is easily shareable with us during the next meeting. We don’t need you to write essays, clear and consistent content is much more important to us.

=== HR Director Hungary- Case Study.docx ===

Introducing the Case Study
We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to  you about your experience in detail. We think a great next step is to explore some role specific scenarios with you to understand how you would approach them. We hope this session will give us a great insight into how you approach work and also, through the questions we ask and the conversation that's generated, give you a better understanding of what it's like to work at Rohlik.
Format
How you prepare for and present your thoughts on the case study is entirely up to you. There is no right or wrong way, the content is more important to us than the packaging!  If you decide to prepare some material, please do share this 1 day prior so we can review it beforehand.


Case Study - HRD Hungary


1. Working schedules
Our Fulfilment centres operate from 3am to 23pm, 7 days a week. Propose a working schedule for FC and logistics (last mile) staff to cover that. Pls consider core shift system, shorter peak periods coverage and handling overtime. How would you staff the operations - consider core employees, as well as agency workers and temporary staff. Include in your proposal approximate cost calculations and state potential risks that could arise from your proposal.

Employees (Internal) --> 794 ; Driver 460 , Picker 67 and Stocker 27, 145 external workers

Average orders  ca. 4000 Orders

2. Attrition
Working in a fulfilment centre as an operator is typically a low paid, yet demanding job. As a result, the attrition tends to be quite high. What are the actions (apart from doubling everybody’s salary) that can be taken from an employer perspective to keep the operators satisfied and hence staying longer with the company? Propose a system that recognises best performers and turns them into long service core employees. 

3. Values and Culture
We are a young company with a strong and distinct culture. As we are growing rapidly, we need to make sure that all our new employees become familiar with our culture and Values ( we call them Ingredients). Also, our Ingredients must be reflected in all our core internal processes to keep the culture alive and trustworthy. 
How do you suggest we roll out Ingredients to all white- and blue-collar employees? How do we make sure that our people understand the desired behaviours and stick to them in their everyday work life?  What is the role of the People & Culture team and what is the role of management? 

4. As we are about to move our FC from one location to another in the same city, what are all the areas that need to be considered from HR perspective to make this move?

Key challenges
The director of quality will face the ambitious challenge of upholding and unifying industry-leading quality standards that not only meet but surpass local regulatory requirements across all markets.

Establish and enforce unified quality standards across Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, and Romania that exceed local regulatory requirements and set new industry benchmarks

Excellent communication and leadership skills to collaborate with suppliers, internal teams, and cross-market stakeholders, fostering a culture of high standards and quality
Fluency in English; familiarity with other European languages is an advantage
Background in quality assurance frameworks such as ISO or Six Sigma is a bonus but not a strict requirement

KPIs:
Enhance customer satisfaction related to product quality, demonstrated by improved feedback scores and a decrease in quality-related complaints
Maintain and consistently improve product quality metrics, ensuring compliance across all markets and setting new benchmarks that exceed industry standards
Achieve and maintain positive audit outcomes with regulatory compliance that surpasses local requirements, supported by efficient automated and systematised processes

The order completion team has a significant impact on the satisfaction of the end customer, who expects to receive the food ordered in the quantity, time and quality as requested.
 
Role Overview

If there is a plastic box missing: the outbound error resolution officer verifies that the plastic box is not still on the conveyor belt or alternatively in a different place in the sorter or in a place with boxes of which the label could not be scanned. If the plastic box is not found, the missing items are added to the bags and the bags are taken for dispatch
If there is no plastic box: the table must be unlocked with a pin code and the contents of the corresponding box must be taken back to where they were stored before by the pickers. This is a box that has been lost (put in the wrong place)
If there is an extra plastic box: the box may be taken for sorting, put in the correct place or alternatively taken to the appropriate table if the order is already being put into bags
If the items are damaged: the items must be taken back to where they were stored before by the pickers
If there is a bag missing: the outbound error resolution officer checks the table where the order was put into bags to see if the missing bag is not waiting there to have items added to it. If the bag is not even on the shelves from which it would be normally dispatched, the cart with damaged bags for dispatch must be checked. Finally, other possible places in the dispatch department must be checked in case the order was placed in more than one bag (it is possible that it had not been scanned by the person responsible for putting the bag back to its place on the shelves from which it would be normally dispatched). If the bag is not found, the rest of the order must be checked to see what items are missing. Then, the missing items must be added to the bag.

=== Senior Brand Manager _ Case study.docx ===
We are absolutely thrilled you are interested to join us at Rohlik Group. By now we have spoken to you about your experience and personality in great detail. Next step is to find out how you tackle a task in reality. 


Case study – Senior Brand Manager
The life of a brand manager in Rohlik Group is fast and often very reactive depending on current events. But whether it's a big campaign or a quick event to promote the sale the whole Rohlík world always revolves around the customer. We make for them the first last and possibly impossible. You can forget most companies that have ever claimed to have a customer first
place, because the rate of how we see it in Rohlík is almost certainly higher. For the customer
we will really do everything. And with this mindset, please write a case study.

Situation
In Rohlik we have two kinds of private labels. The first one is the premium brand “Bez kompromisu” (in EN "Without Compromise"), which is focusing on non-price-sensitive customers. Under this brand we would like to offer only excellent products that are highest quality and are from small & authentic local producers and farmers, i.e. they are not industrial produced. This brand is part of what Rohlik Group stands for and expresses Rohlik DNA: “eat well and live well”. We intend to have only one premium brand for all our product categories, i.e. no different premium brands for different product categories. We are still working on this concept and for a better insight, you can take a look at our existing premium private label “Bez kompromisu” (in EN "Without Compromise"), which is currently available only at Rohlik.cz.

The second kind of private label is the Value for Money family (VFM). These products have very good quality with very competitive selling prices. With these SKUs we want to attract especially more price-sensitive customers who now buy traditional private labels in brick & mortar retailers. Mostly these are products with A-brand quality but at a significantly cheaper price. Currently we are selling the following brands: Mii, Dacello, Pappudio, Moddia, Fjoru, Sutcha, Ubomi. More information here.

Task:
You as a Senior brand manager in a private label squad were asked by the Group Head of Private Label to prepare the plan for the marketing launch of the latest private label "Ubomi" in the coffee category from our VFM family. How will you differentiate yourself from your retail competitors? What channels would you use? How would you boost category penetration in the customer basket? 

Additional information:
- coffee is an important differentiator for grocery shopping
- simplify the customer's choice in the low and medium price tiers of roasted coffee (beans, grounded, capsules)
- blend coffee, but also single origin
- slow drum roasted coffee with RainForest Alliance certification
- capsules´specifics: 100% biobased capsules, aluminium free, 100% home-compostable (TÜV certification)


Guidelines:
● We are looking for conceptual and strategic thinking, from creative to innovative
thinking, after demonstration of commercial thinking, feeling for customer insight up to
the ability to formulate and conduct end-2-end execution.
● We are an online business playing in a strong brick and mortar field
● New solutions and creative excellence



And one big tip in conclusion - Rohlík is not mainstream, it positively challenges the market and
classic marketing concept. We do nothing just to do it and we look for everything
more than it might seem at first glance. We are new, we are playful and we talk to our customers
as we speak to each other (within spelling, of course). We like puns and
game with czech. We really do everything for our customers and we build them on a pedestal even in the brand.

Senior Recruiter - Case Study
Thank you for your interest in joining Rohlik Group. As we’ve discussed, the next step is to see how you tackle a real-world scenario with the constraints of high volume and limited resources.

Situation
You are tasked with filling 50 critical roles across four markets by the end of Q4 (the current date is September 30th). These hires must support a major product launch, and any delays will significantly impact the business.
Hiring Breakdown:
20 Marketing Specialists (5 in CZ, 5 in DE, 5 in AT, 5 in HU)
10 UX Designers (5 in CZ, 5 in DE)
8 CRM Tech Specialists (remote)
7 Trade Marketing Specialists (CZ, AT)
5 Logistics Coordinators (CZ)
Challenges/Constraints:
Budget: You have a limited recruitment budget of €10,000 per month, which must cover sourcing, ads, and any external agencies.
Team Size: You have only one dedicated recruiter, who can process a maximum of 12 candidates per week. Your assistance will be limited due to managing other initiatives.
Market Competition: You are operating in highly competitive markets with low conversion rates:
Marketing Specialists: 1 out of 6 candidates receive offers.
UX Designers: 1 out of 7 candidates receive offers.
CRM Tech Specialists: 1 out of 4 candidates receive offers.
Trade Marketing Specialists: 1 out of 6 candidates receive offers.
Logistics Coordinators: 1 out of 5 candidates receive offers.
Time Pressure: Due to project deadlines, hiring needs to be completed within 60 days, or the business will suffer a loss in customer experience and revenue.
Interview Process: The process involves 3 stages:
Recruiter prescreen
1st Business interview
2nd Business interview
Additional Considerations:
Sourcing channels: Online job portals are generating lower quality candidates, and referral programs in the past have been slow. You will need to decide on sourcing strategy balancing quality and speed.
Stakeholder involvement: Hiring managers are highly occupied and can only dedicate limited time to interviews, so scheduling will be tight.
Attrition risk: 10% of hired candidates tend to leave during their probation period.

Task
1. Prioritization & Strategy
Prioritize which roles to focus on first based on business impact, resource constraints, and market competition.
Develop a recruitment strategy that allocates the budget across channels. How will you balance speed and quality of hires given the tight timelines?
Propose solutions to mitigate stakeholder availability issues in the interview process.
2. Resource & Time Management
Considering the conversion rates, calculate how many candidates you will need to source per role, and how many applications will be required to fill all positions.
With one recruiter and high volume, how will you manage the screening process to ensure efficiency without compromising on candidate quality?
3. Risk Management
Given the 10% attrition risk during probation, how would you adjust your hiring strategy to ensure you meet business needs by the end of Q3?
4. KPIs & Success Tracking
Define the KPIs to track during this process (e.g., time to hire, interview-to-offer ratio, cost per hire) and describe how you will measure the success of your hiring campaign.

Deliverables
Present your strategy in a format of your choice (e.g., presentation, spreadsheet, or document) and be prepared to discuss your approach during the next meeting. Please submit your materials 24 hours in advance.
